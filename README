* The source codes are not guaranteed to be accepted. If you want really to know whether a code is true, you can check my status page on the competing website.

* Some source codes are written for short coding, which means the codes are hard to read.

* Coding rules that I used in my codes for competitive programming are not discouraged for general programming.
